# Contract Comparison Agent Optimization

## Overview

This document summarizes the optimizations made to the Contract Comparison Agent to improve performance by implementing parallel processing.

## Key Optimizations

### 1. Parallel Contract Chunking

- **Before**: Contracts were chunked sequentially, one after the other
- **After**: Both contracts are now chunked simultaneously using `Promise.all()`
- **Benefit**: Reduces processing time by ~50% for this step

### 2. Parallel Clause Extraction

- **Before**: Clauses were extracted sequentially for each chunk and department
- **After**: 
  - Implemented `processChunksForDepartment` function that processes chunks in parallel
  - Added batching (3 chunks at a time) to prevent rate limiting
  - All departments are processed in parallel
- **Benefit**: Significant time savings, especially for contracts with many sections

### 3. Parallel Summary Generation

- **Before**: Department summaries were generated sequentially
- **After**: All department summaries for both versions are generated in parallel
- **Benefit**: Reduces processing time proportional to the number of departments

### 4. Parallel Diff Generation

- **Before**: Diffs between department summaries were generated sequentially
- **After**: All diffs are generated in parallel
- **Benefit**: Reduces processing time proportional to the number of departments

### 5. Additional Improvements

- **Timeout Handling**: Added `withTimeout` helper function to prevent API calls from hanging indefinitely
- **Error Handling**: Improved error handling throughout the process
- **Progress Tracking**: Updated the UI to show real-time progress of each step

## Performance Impact

The optimizations are expected to reduce the total processing time by approximately 60-70% for typical contracts, with the exact improvement depending on:

1. The number of chunks in each contract
2. The number of departments being analyzed
3. The OpenAI API response times

## UI Enhancements

- Added a progress bar showing overall completion percentage
- Added status indicators for each processing step
- Implemented real-time updates based on console log messages

## Future Optimization Opportunities

1. **Caching**: Implement caching of chunking results for previously analyzed contracts
2. **Streaming**: Use streaming API responses where applicable to start processing partial results
3. **Worker Threads**: For server-side deployments, consider using worker threads for CPU-intensive tasks
4. **Selective Analysis**: Only analyze sections that have changed between versions
